SONUS-ROMANUS is a short 251-byte program that plays Roman numerals as music, assigning a different note to I,V,X,L,C,D, and M.  It was written in 6502 assembler for the Apple 2 Plus, and was entered in the 256 Byte Oldschool competition at Lovebyte 2024, where it somehow came in dead last in a field of 21 entries :(

It takes nearly 53 minutes to go through the all the Roman numerals from 1 to 3999.  As a piece of music it is interesting in that every "measure" is different, but there is a reoccurring 10-number cadence that slowly varies by length and perceived tempo, as the length of the numbers gets stretched out longer and longer before suddenly collapsing into an accelerated fanfare that excitedly heralds values like 40, 90, 400, 900, 1400, 1900, etc.

I tried various systems of notes, following major and minor and chromatic scales, as well as cycles of fifths and others, before settling on I,X,C,M forming a Dmaj7 chord, and V,L,D forming a D#maj chord.
